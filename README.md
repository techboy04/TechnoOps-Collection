# TechnoOps Collection
![GitHub Downloads (all assets, all releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/techboy04/TechnoOps-Collection/total?label=Downloads) ![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/techboy04/Technoops-Collection?label=Latest%20Version)

A massive collection of scripts and mods I made over the years of making mods!

This mod idea was heavily inspired by [Reapers Collection on Black Ops 3](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2801151115&searchtext=Reapers+Collection).

## The mod includes:
* Exfil - Finish the match with style! Similar to Cold War + Black Ops 6.
* Rampage Statue - Similar to the Rampage Inducer but cant be disabled, zombies always run and there is no round delay.
* Gobblegums - Utilize Gobblegums in Black Ops 2!
* Global ATM - Allow players to share points to one public bank.
* Infected (Disabled by Default) - Similar to Advance Warfares Infection mechanic where players get infected randomly when damaged and can be cured by touching the cure skull
* Custom Game options to customize your experience. Through Custom Game menu and Dvars!
* Instant Pack a Punch - Upgrading is instant. No need to wait!
* Points underneath Perks - Crouch to get extra points underneath perk machines.
* Mod Quests currently available in Tranzit and Nuketown.
* zm_weapons and zm_perks integration from [sehteria](https://forum.plutonium.pw/user/sehteria)

## Lightweight Features
- Health Bar
- Shield Bar
- Enemy Counter
- Hitmarker w/ Customizable sounds
- Secret Music for Survival Maps
- Zone Notifier - Shows the name of the area the player is in.
- Compass - Shows the players direction, current zone, and angle.
- Grabbable Starter Weapon - Ability to pickup the starter weapon instead of spawning with it.

## Powerup and Perk Changes
- Bonus Points is on all maps.
- Max Ammo fills the magazine aswell.
- Nuke gives points per zombie killed.
- Carpenter repairs shield.
- Mulekick saves and retrieves the third weapon between downs.
- Doubletap gives faster mystery box spins and buildable repairs.
- Speedcola lets players perform actions quicker like swapping weapons.
- Staminup gives unlimited sprint.

There are also SOME map specific things aswell! (Not alot)

Tranzit:
* Fast Travel - Quickly teleport around the map.
* Better Power - When the power turns on it will open Pack A Punch along with any other power required doors.
* Toggleable fog and denizens - Be able to remove or keep the infamous fog and denizens.
* Jetgun has unlimited ammo - Jetgun doesn't go kaboom. Making it more fun to use.
* Ability to remove Lava damage
* Wall Weapon present in Town
* A ladder to travel from Town to between Diner and Farm
* Additional ladder placed in Diner to galvaknuckles
* Jetgun can be picked up by everyone
* A bunch of secrets

Origins:
* Toggleable Mud effects - Change whether you want to keep the mud movement or not.
* Removal of early voice lines from Samantha
* Right foot of Robot always open regardless if the hatch is opened or not
* Removal of recapture rounds

Nuketown:
* Perks Management - Choose how you want the perks to drop, from its normal behavior, every round, every time the bell chimes, or even all at once!

Mob of the Dead:
* [Cat has 9 lives integration](https://forum.plutonium.pw/post/2557)
* Afterlife doesnt down when mana expires, similar to the Beast from Shadows of Evil

## Want a little fun? Try out our four gamemodes!
* Gun Game = Advance through the gun ladder by getting a certain amount of kills to progress, be the first to go through the entire ladder to win. Downs will demote you.
* Cranked = Survive as long as possible with a ticking time bomb that resets with every zombie kill, as the rounds progress, the max timer will being to shrink.
* Mystery Guns = Guns randomize after every round.
* Dead Light Green Light = Based off the Black Ops 6 LTM, players get double points during green light, upon red light you have to freeze aswell as getting no points, if you move, you get a punishment.
* Sharpshooter = Get a random gun every few seconds.
* Team Cranked = Similar to regular Cranked but the timer is shared.
* Zombie Snacks = Health doesnt regen and drops slowly, zombies drop energy to replenish health.

## **Configuration**
The mod by default has preset settings but important settings can be changed via the Custom Games menu. All other settings are also configurable via the console. Both methods will save the choice for the next time you relaunch the mod.
